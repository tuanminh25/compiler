/*
 * ArrayInitExpr.java  
 *
 * Used for representing an expression provided for initialising an array
 * variable according to the the following production in the VC grammar:
 *
 * initialiser         -> "{" expr ( "," expr )* "}"
 *
 * Given the following two declarations, where arrays a and b are declared:
 *
 * int a[2] = {1, 2}; 
 * int b = {3,4,5};
 *
 * {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5} are two array initialisation expressions, i.e., ArrayInitExprs.
 *
 * See t43.vc and t44.vc and their ASTs given in the spec of Assignment 3.
 *
 * When an ArrayInitExpr node is drawn, ArrayInitExpr is abbreviated to ArrInitExpr.
 *
 * See also ArrayExprList.java.
